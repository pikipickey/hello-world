Hi There, it's me, pikipickey. I'm very interesting in creating physics education app with code. But I don't know how to start. I hopefully, get a lot of any useful experience by joining github.com.,I'm sorry, if my english is not good, I'm very pleased you can correct my english. So by the time, my english will be better. Thank you.
